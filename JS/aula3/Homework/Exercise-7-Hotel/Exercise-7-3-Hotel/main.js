// ## Exercise 7
// ### Beachwalk Hotel üèñ <br />
// Let's calculate how much a hotel stay costs at the fantastic Beachwalk Hotel

// ### 7.1
// The price for night is `90‚Ç¨`<br />
// Ask the user for how many nights he would like to stay and print the total cost.

// ### 7.2
// Breakfast is an extra `10‚Ç¨`<br />
// Continue from the last exercise and ask the user if he would like to include breakfast.<br />
// Print the total cost.

// ### 7.3
// Discount<br />
// Let's discount guests who stay for longer periods.<br />
// Continue from the last exercise and calculate a discount.<br />
// > 5 nights or more, 10%<br />
// > 10 nights or more, 15%<br />
// > 15 nights or more, 20%<br />
// ```
// Only the room is affected by the discount. Breakfast price stays the same.
// ```
